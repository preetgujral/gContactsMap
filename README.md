# gContactsMap
Tool for showing your google contacts on a map, filterable by group.

Development has not started on this project yet.

Goal is to display a map that shows the location of your google contacts. The primary feature is that you can choose to only show contacts from certain groups.
This could potentially be delivered as a chrome plugin too.

If anyone is interested in collaborating, please do not hesitate to reach out.

If you have any features you would like to see, you can submit as an issue and I will review and add to my queue!
